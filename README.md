# ML From Scratch

This project contains machine learning implementations from scratch using Python.

## Setup

This project uses Poetry for dependency management. 

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Poetry

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

3. Start Jupyter notebook:
```bash
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

## Dependencies

- **numpy**: Numerical computing library
- **matplotlib**: Plotting library
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for reference and comparison
- **jupyter**: Interactive notebook environment

## Project Structure

- `mlr.ipynb`: Main notebook for machine learning implementations
- `pyproject.toml`: Poetry configuration and dependencies
